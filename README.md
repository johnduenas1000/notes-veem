# Wordpress carousel integration tutorial.

I have included a carousel that will be available for the main page which has reused the "banner" (full-width-image) format that was beign used before:

The edit seccion of this page has a block that allows us to customize the background image, the text, the position of the text and other characteristics that allow us to customize the "banner".

I have taken advantage of all this to add the capability to this tool to group multiple blocks with the same characteristics in a carousel.

# How to do it?

To enable the grouping of multiple banners we will only have to enable the To Carousel option of this block like this: ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/113730473/196768842-df9cd02d-8480-448f-9fc1-3b7b03d6a10d.png)

We should also keep in mind that we must add several banners with the same condition (enabled To Carousel), In the editor it should look like this: (Sample group of minified blocks).

Remember that to duplicate the block that will allow us to add a new banner we have to click on this button:

# End
If you have done all steps well so far, you should get something like this on the page:
